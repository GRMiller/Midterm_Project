Once upon a time in the mystical land of Detroit, there lived two great friends, Adam and Garrett. They lived with their mother Anna and their faithful TA Adam. Adam is a really cool dog.  He was always close to Anna. He had teeth like a sabre tooth tiger, but was a vegetarian. Hot dogs are delicious. Anna is a really cool TA.
